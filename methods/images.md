## Images

We could create an [image grid](https://unheardcity.org.uk/methods/src/imagegrid.html).

One way of using this is to determine the dominant devices and assemblages. 

The images have image metadata that can be used.

The [exiftool](https://exiftool.org) can get the data from digital files, such as GPS tags. The data was used here to extract GPS tags that are known to be in these images as I put them in there.
