## Images

We could create an [image grid](./src/imagegrid.html).

One way of using this is to determine the dominant devices and assemblages. 

The images have image metadata that can be used.

The [exiftool](https://exiftool.org) can get the data from digital files, such as GPS tags. The data was used here to extract GPS tags that are known to be in these images as I put them in there. Other metadata is present, such as device and angle, but are of less use for this work. 

As you may tell, there is quite some work to do here.
