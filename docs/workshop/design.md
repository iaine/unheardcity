## Design 

### Basic Designs

At a basic level, sonification design might look at:

* volume, 
* pitch, 
* tempo or beat, 
* direction (panning or spatial?)

or a combination of the above. 

These provide a basic form of sound. We might take a more designed approach and think about other aspects. We could use alter the sound, such as adding a lower tone to the sound to make it a bit deeper, or we can use the other types of sound. 

Here you might think about the type of data to be sonified and the approaches, such as qualitative - such as categories - or quantitative - like discrete numbers or continuous values like time series. 

## Mapping Data to Sound

You might think about other approaches like earcons, audicons, or even samples. Here you are using more complex sounds and beginning to interpret sounds.  

We could use audio graphs, such as line charts, to show relationships over time or more in depth sounds, such as using noise for sonifications of networks, like some earlier work on [JANET](https://iaine.github.io/janet/traffic.html). (Emsley, De Roure and Chamberlain, A, 2017). Two approaches are taken here: firstly, the noise of the traffic and secondly, a more audio graphic version with a voice over to contextualise the data.

Another way is to create layers of sound to contextualise data. In the UnheardCity work, sonifications of the data were overlaid with sound recordings to provide some context from the walk. [https://unheardcity.org.uk/sounds/soundscape.html](https://unheardcity.org.uk/sounds/soundscape.html)

### Sketching Techniques

Vocal Sketching (Ekman and Rinott, 2010) where you "sketch" ideas about the sonification and record it on your phone or onto your computer. If you have a Mac, then GarageBand can be used to record audio and alter it. 

[Sketching sound](https://aurawalmer.com/total-solar-eclipse-2024) using pen and paper is another design method that Aura Walmer discusses along with how the listener could be helped to understand the sonification. 

### Tools

You may want to use your own tools, if you have some. If not, [TwoTone](https://twotone.io) is a good starting point for experimenting and is available online. 

Found sounds, either that you have recorded ourselves or downloaded from a sample source, might add in extra types of sound to make the relationship more obvious. These can be put into tools liek GarageBand or Audacity and manipulated to create a sonification. 

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) is a cross-platform tool that can record and alter audio files. It comes with some effects to do basic prototypes using samples or voice sketching. 

### Exercise

In this workshop, we will take the use the design mapping sheet (Ciuccarelli and Lenzi, 2020) and apply it to some data to work to design a sonification. It might be useful to apply some of the considerations from the [listening](listening) session to think about the potential effect of the audio representation. 

Other approaches are listed in the bibliography.
