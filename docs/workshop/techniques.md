## Techniques and Exercise

### Sketching Techniques

Vocal Sketching (Ekman and Rinott, 2010) where you "sketch" ideas about the sonification and record it on your phone or onto your computer. If you have a Mac, then GarageBand can be used to record audio and alter it. 

[Sketching sound](https://aurawalmer.com/total-solar-eclipse-2024) using pen and paper is another design method that Aura Walmer discusses along with how the listener could be helped to understand the sonification. 

### Tools

You may want to use your own tools, if you have some. If not, [TwoTone](https://twotone.io) is a good starting point for experimenting and is available online. 

Found sounds, either that you have recorded ourselves or downloaded from a sample source, might add in extra types of sound to make the relationship more obvious. These can be put into tools liek GarageBand or Audacity and manipulated to create a sonification. 

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) is a cross-platform tool that can record and alter audio files. It comes with some effects to do basic prototypes using samples or voice sketching. 

### Exercise

In this workshop, you can design your own sonification using the various techniques presented here using your own data. Alternatively, you can re-design a sonification and think about what you would want to add or change.

You are free to use any technique that you are comfortable with, or to try new things. 

If you do not have data, then here is some [trial data](https://github.com/iaine/unheardcity/tree/dev/docs/workshop/workshop_data) to start.
